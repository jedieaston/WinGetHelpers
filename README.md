# WinGetHelpers!

These are some cmdlets I hastely made to help support microsoft/winget-pkgs. Maybe they'll help you too. 

I'm not very good at PowerShell, which is why it looks so bad, but all of these work on my machine(tm) so as long as you are on Windows 10 and have winget installed,
they should all work for you too (except Get-GitHubReleases, which requires the GitHub CLI. I'll fix that eventually.) I'll add comments when I get time.
